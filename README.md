# Predicting_drug_dosing
I used key data on water quality, flow rate, and pH to predict drug dosage through characteristic engineering that included hysteresis properties. I independently developed and optimized an LSTM model to adjust drug dosage to maintain pH stability during water treatment. By applying dropout and batch normalization techniques, I managed to improve the performance of the model.

py: show the function of the code and the pipeline
