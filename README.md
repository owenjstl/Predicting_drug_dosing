# Predicting_drug_dosing
In my current company, I used key data on water quality, flow rate, and pH to predict drug dosage through characteristic engineering that included hysteresis properties. I independently developed and optimized an LSTM model to adjust drug dosage to maintain pH stability during water treatment. By applying dropout and batch normalization techniques, I managed to improve the performance of the model. I worked closely with my colleagues to reach my goals through the product lifecycle. I'm also responsible for communicating data-driven results succinctly to non-technical people. In the end, I successfully deployed the model and achieved a 40% reduction in consumption, saving the company an estimated $100,000 in costs.

For some reason, I can't upload the company's code here. But I can show my understanding of the LSTM model here.
